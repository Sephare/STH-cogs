# STH-cogs
Contains the Red Discord Bot cogs made/used by STH. 
Currently only supports V2 of the bot, V3 branch for working on new code. 

When adding this repository to bot's repo list, make the master branch 'STH', make the V2_testing branch 'test', make the V3_in_progress branch 'v3'. Could change if we have better names for these. 


Working Cogs:
- seqreact (V3 only): based on smartreact, but allows you to send a sequence of reactions

Wishlist: 
- make saido chesto standalone
- make oh my 
- make ayaya react support regex
